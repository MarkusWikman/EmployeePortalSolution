In choosing to develop the Employee Portal as an ASP.NET MVC project rather than opting for a minimal web api approach, I weighed several key factors. Firstly, my familiarity with MVC frameworks from previous projects instilled confidence in my ability to effectively utilize its features to meet the project requirements efficiently. Building upon this familiarity enabled a smoother development process, reducing potential learning curves and accelerating project delivery.

Additionally, knowing that our teacher supported the use of MVC for this project provided reassurance that my chosen approach was aligned with course objectives. This endorsement validated my decision and affirmed that MVC was a suitable fit for the project scope while also accommodating my personal expertise and preferences.

Furthermore, considering the nature of our application as an employee portal requiring robust data management capabilities, MVC's established architecture and mature ecosystem offered the scalability and maintainability necessary for long-term success. By leveraging MVC's separation of concerns and established design patterns, I could ensure a clean and organized codebase conducive to future enhancements and updates.

Moreover, I deliberately chose not to pursue a web shop project, as some other students did, because I found the challenge of developing an employee portal more stimulating and relevant to my interests and career aspirations.

In summary, my decision to opt for ASP.NET MVC was informed by a combination of past experience, teacher guidance, project-specific considerations, and personal preference. By leveraging MVC's strengths, I aimed to deliver a solution tailored to our needs while capitalizing on my existing skills as a developer.
